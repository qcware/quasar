    "A fundamental operation encountered in qubit hardware is the process of measurement. Generally, one prepares a quantum state by running a quantum circuit and then projectively measures each qubit to determine if that qubit ends up in the $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ state. The collective measurement result over all qubits is a binary string, e.g., $|0011\\rangle$, which we refer to as a `Ket`. This procedure is repeated `nmeasurement` times, with different `Ket`s appearing probabilistically according to the square of the amplitude of each `Ket` in the quantum state. The fundamental output from this overall process is a histogram of `Ket` strings observed together with the number of times each was observed. We refer to this overall output as a `MeasurementResult` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naming:** The names of these two classes were selected after much debate. For `Ket`, we could have used `int` with a fixed endian condition, `str` which we would trust the user to always be composed of `0` and `1`, or a class which could alternatively be named `Ket`, `String`, or `Configuration`. We decided to use `Ket` to force the order, typing, and correctness of this concept, and to make the indexing of `MeasurementResult` also support direct indexing by `str` (cast to `Ket` under the hood) to make things easy. For `MeasurementResult`, we could have used a `dict` or other map, or a class which could alternatively be named `MeasurementResult`, `Histogram`, `Counts`, `Shots`, or any variation thereof. We decided to use `MeasurementResult` to keep things maximally explicit. Note that most users will encounter these objects as the output of `quasar` library methods, and will rarely need to explicitly construct `Ket` or `MeasurementResult` objects. In this case, the manipulation of these data structures seems straightforward, and allows for easy casting to other data structures that the user might prefer."

    "There are some minor ambiguities encountered in the literature and codes principally revolving around the question of whether the qubits in the `Ket`s are indexed as `|0123>` or `|3210>` (e.g., big- vs. little-endian binary ordering). To help combat this, we always use a well-defined `Ket` object in `quasar` that forces the use of the standard Nielson-Chuang order of `|0123>`. This `Ket` object is constructed from a binary string of the measurement result for each qubit in Nielson-Chuang order:"
