quasar/quasar - the galactic core of the quasar library, containing all primary
    code.

# Contents 

circuit.py - the quasar quantum circuit library. Includes Circuit, Gate, and
    Matrix classes.
pauli.py - the quasar Pauli operator library. Includes the Pauli class and
    PauliString, PauliOperator, and PauliStarter utility classes (most of which
    are simple stubs used only for symbolic algebra of Pauli objects).
measurement.py - the quasar qubit measurement library. Includes the Ket and
    Measurement classes.
run.py - the quasar runtime methods library. Includes the build_native_circuit,
    run_statevector, run_measurement, and run_pauli_expectation methods.
resolution.py - the native-to-quasar translation library. Includes
    build_quasar_circuit.

backend.py - the general hardware/software backend library. Includes Backend
    base class.
